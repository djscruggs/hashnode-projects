This is a repository of for my [tutorial on Real-time Password Verification](https://djscruggs.hashnode.dev/real-time-password-verification-in-react)

It has some minor changes to styling to accomodate running all within the [App.tsx](./src/App.tsx) file. 

It includes a tailwindcss configuration and should run out of the box.

To use, cd to this directory run `npm install` followed by `npm run dev`
