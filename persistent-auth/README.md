This is a companion repo to my tutorial on [persisting auth state in React](https://djscruggs.hashnode.dev/auth-state-in-react-with-localstorage "persisting auth state in React").

It includes a tailwindcss configuration and should run out of the box.

To use, cd to this directory and run `npm install` followed by `npm run dev`
